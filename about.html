  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Dawid Czarneta, i live in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. I work as DevOps Engineer at FINGO Software House.

I started this blog to share some of my learning process, when I learn new technologies. I also want to share some of my thoughts, projects which I create and books I read. Because English is not my primary language I want to improve it.

I'm passionate about IT related topics, actually discovering the cloud, especially AWS world.
