Sourcery is the fourth book from the fantasy series of Discworld written by Terry Pratchett.

The novel is about sourcerers - the most powerful mage on the Discworld. As eight is a powerful magical number on Discworld, men born as the eighth son of an eighth son are commonly wizards.

The title character wanted to take power at an Invisible University.
Rincewind, along with Conena and Nijel, opposed him.


This part did not appeal to me compared to the previous parts, due to the rather complex storyline, but it's a good break from complicated technical titles.

My rate 4/10
